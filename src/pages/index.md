  title2: ABOUT ME
---
My name is Chantal (She/they).

I’ve grown up in Bristol and are proud to offer my services here. My doula work is informed by my love of herbal medicine, activism, food and feminism. I've always doula'd in one way or another and it felt natural for my to pursue this as a career.

My role is to support you to have a positive journey into parenthood that is confident, informed and empowered. I am totally impartial and believe my role is to guide you to have the birth you want.

I have trauma informed doula training from Conscious Birthing, and I’m building upon these skills with Jen Muir, Badass Birth. I’ve also completed a Doula UK introductory workshop, LGBTQ+ competency in maternity workshop with AJ Silver and an Introduction to herbal medicine course with Urban Fringe, Bristol.

Previous to this, I’ve studied Peace Studies at University, volunteered for human rights organisations abroad and got my hands dirty at community garden projects. Demanding for justice, human rights and equality has always been a central thread to all of my work.

Alongside this, I've worked for many years serving tasty food and exploring new ways of nourishing our bodies. In my spare time I enjoy foraging for herbal medicines and furthering my plant knowledge.\
\
In the future I will be available for postpartum work, whether that be cooking you nourishing meals, providing herbal remedies and/or holding baby while you have a breather.
