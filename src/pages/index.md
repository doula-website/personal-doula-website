    Because you want continuity of care 


    An extra pair of hands


    You want an advocate


    Someone that can offer unbiased information and support


    You want advice on chest feeding, postpartum meals, and someone to hold the
    baby while you have some well needed ‘me’ time


    Because the name for a group of doula’s is a cuddle and who doesn’t like a
    cuddle?


    Or simply because you want to hang out with me


    I long for a day when doula’s don’t need to exist but the science shows that
    doula support greatly favours birth outcomes. Having a doula can mean less
    pain relief, lower instances of intervention, and even shorter births*.


    You possess everything you need for an epic birth and we are simply here to
    support you.

  title2: ABOUT ME
---
My name is Chantal (she/they).

I’ve grown up in Bristol and are proud to offer my services here. My doula work is informed by my love of herbal medicine, activism, food, and feminism. I've always doula'd in one way or another and it felt natural for me to pursue this as a career.

My role is to support you to have a positive journey into parenthood that is confident, informed, and empowered. I am totally impartial and believe my role is to guide you to have the birth you want.

I have trauma-informed doula training from Conscious Birthing, and I’m building upon these skills with Jen Muir, Badass Birth. I’ve also completed a Doula UK introductory workshop, LGBTQ+ competency in maternity workshop with AJ Silver, and an introduction to herbal medicine course with Urban Fringe, Bristol.

Previous to this, I’ve studied Peace Studies at University, volunteered for human rights organisations abroad, and got my hands dirty at community garden projects. Demanding for justice, human rights and equality has always been a central thread to all of my work.

Alongside this, I've worked for many years serving tasty food and exploring new ways of nourishing our bodies. In my spare time, I enjoy foraging for herbal medicines and furthering my plant knowledge.\
\
In the future I will be available for postpartum work, whether that be cooking you nourishing meals, providing herbal remedies and/or holding the baby while you have a breather.
